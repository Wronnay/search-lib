# Wronnay Search Library
A library of classes which can be used to build a search engine.

Project inspired by the simple "Wronnay Search Engine" from 2014 (which is deprecated).

This project uses both, Python and PHP. (It's my first Python Project but my existing code from my search engine uses PHP).

When finished, this project will probably use Python (because it's the better solution for a search engine).
